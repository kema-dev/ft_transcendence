# kema-dev

## ongoing

* TODO make `lobby_name` uniques
* TODO find about `lobby_name` to group players (how to make a player join a lobby / socket.io rooms)

* TODO autofill option (join first available lobby)

## later

* TODO make the API **NOT** accessible from the outside (correct backend_status accordingly)
* TODO make backend is up endpoint redirect to frontend
